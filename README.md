## üìÅ About the Data
The dashboard uses a file called `mc3_updated.csv` ‚Äî this must remain in the root directory (the same folder as setup.py). It contains:
- Population
- Income
- Racial demographics
- OBGYN access per 100K
- Consultations
- etc

If you update the data, keep the same column names.

- **Render:** https://render.com/docs/deploy-dash
- **Heroku:** https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python
